Effect of Daylight Savings on Financial Markets

These notebooks analyze select Kaggle data for a significant effect on financial markets due to the Daylight Savings Time effects, which has been known to cause problems and uncertainty in human behavior. The data is from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehallmar/daily-historical-stock-prices-1970-2018

This data contains daily individual stock prices from 1971-2018 from NASDAQ and NYSE. Each row has the ticker (stock code), high, low, open, close, adjusted close, and volume.

The notebooks also analyze the Nikkei 225 Index. This is an index used by the Japanese stock exchange; Japan does not observe DST and so this acts as a control group.
